.SH DESCRIPTION

Remove duplicates from a fastq file using fastq2tsv to reformat
to tab-separated data for easier sorting, then using Unix sort
and an awk script to remove adjacent entries with the same
sequence (column 2 of the TSV).  Per latest benchmarks,
seqkit rmdup --by-sequence and our own C version, fastq-dedup, are about
3x as fast.  However,
fastq-dedup.sh does not require the entire file in memory as it
uses the Unix sort command, which automatically breaks large
files into chunks for later merging.
