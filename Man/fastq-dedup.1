.SH DESCRIPTION

Remove duplicates from a fastq file by inhaling all records and sorting
with a libc sort function.

If memory is a limiting factor for your deduplication jobs, see
fastq-dedup.sh(3), a shell script utilizing the Unix sort command, which
automatically breaks large files into chunks so they can be sorted within
available memory.
