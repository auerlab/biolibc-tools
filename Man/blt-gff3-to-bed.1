.SH DESCRIPTION

.B blt gff3-to-bed
converts GFF3 input to BED output.  Currently it generates 6-column BED
output with scores set to 0.

Note that GFF3 contains roughly the same information as BED and is generally
considered a more capable format, so
converting from GFF3 to BED is normally not desirable. blt gff3-to-bed is
provided as a stop-gap for working with tools that don't yet support the GTF
or GFF3 formats.
